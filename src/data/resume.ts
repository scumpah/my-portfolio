  tagline: 'Systems thinker. Problem solver. AI-native builder. Impact at scale.',
  about: `10+ years architecting distributed systems that handle millions of users and move serious money — worldwide scale, with deep focus on EMEA and US markets over the past few years.

I obsess over reliability, cut through complexity, and leave systems simpler than I found them. At Personio, I'm part of the Foundations group — rethinking architectural decisions from the ground up, turning years of accumulated complexity into clean, maintainable systems that keep pace with aggressive customer growth.

I treat AI as a first-class engineering tool: I've shipped GenAI products in production, piloted prompt-first workflows org-wide, and I'm continuously pushing the frontier on what AI-assisted engineering looks like in practice.`,
